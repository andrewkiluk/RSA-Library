/*
These functions work much in the same way to their simpler counterparts declared above, with some important caveats.
Sticking with the style of rsa_encrypt and rsa_decrypt, rsa_oaep_encrypt and rsa_oaep_decrypt return a pointer to a heap array
that should be freed when it is no longer needed. For ease of use the value pointed to by message_size will refer to the size of that buffer,
which depends on the keys. A rough estimate is: rsa_oaep_encrypt of a buffer of size m will produce a buffer of size 5*(m +k1 +k2) and, in a similar way,
rsa_oaep_decrypt of a buffer of size m with k1 and k2 will produce a buffer of size (m - k1 - k2)/5.
I have included an explanation of the encryption scheme at the appropriate place in the .c file, but wikipedia has an excellent explanation.
